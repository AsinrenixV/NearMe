            Trikkur Mahadeva Temple is a rock-cut cave temple in Trikkur village in Thrissur District in Kerala believed to have been built in the 7th or 8th century. Being a cave temple, Buddhist and Jain monks used the site to meditate alongside the Hindu monks. It is a protected monument under the Department of Archaeology, Govt of Kerala since 1966. The temple and its premises are now owned by Paliyam Trust which is managed by Kshetra Samrakshana Samiti (Temple Protection Committee).The main deity of this temple is Lord Shiva a.k.a. Mahadeva, as the name suggests. It is believed that the huge Shivalinga here was consecrated by Lord Agni. Thus, it is believed that Lord Agni always worships Lord Shiva, and he accompanies him. Due to this belief, the idol is not carried outside for processions on rainy days.

            The temple is located on the top of the hillock inside a 30 feet long and 12 feet broad natural cave. The huge Shiva Linga is at the southern end of the cave, just above this there is a waterhole that never dries even in the hottest days during summers. The Shiva Linga faces the east, but the door of the Garbhagriha is faced towards North. The Linga is in the center, fixed on to a rectangular pedestal. There is an evergreen pond on the top of the rock. Since 1966, the temple is a protected monument under the Department of Archaeology.
